<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Start from a foundation of integrity. Guide every decision with honesty and transparency. Values are lived through actions, not words.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Empathy leads the way. Every interaction is an opportunity to uplift and support. Spend more time listening than talking. Consider other perspectives when making decisions. &nbsp; </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Aim to improve humanity through every action. Trust is best built through consistent actions. Know your values and stay true to them. Own your mistakes, they're an opportunity to learn and improve. Be kind always.</p>
