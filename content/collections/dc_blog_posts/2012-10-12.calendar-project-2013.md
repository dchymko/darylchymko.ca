title: 'Calendar Project 2013?'

Friends, I need your help. Every holiday season I print up  <a href="/images/dc_blog_posts/2011/12/calendar-project/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">calendars</a> from photos I've taken of my travels.  Last year I sold them to friends and family and gave the money to a <a href="http://www.planeterra.org/mayan-community-homestay-project-projects-55.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Planeterra</a> project that I visited while travelling in Guatemala. In fact many of the photos in the calendar were from that very project.

I was happy that I was able to get about 25 people to commit to this endeavour, but in the end the production (and time) costs left me wondering if it was even worth it. I spent about $400 out of pocket which may have gone to better use if I had just donated it directly to the project without printing anything.

So I'm thinking I needing to revisit my approach. I have a few options
a) Come up with a different product
b) Come up with a different payment scheme
c) Come up with an entirely different approach altogether

I'd appreciate your input on this. For (a), would you still be interested in a photo calendar or is there something else you would find useful? In terms of (b) I had the idea of spreading the donation out over the year ($5 a month for 12 months).

FYI,  the projects I'm looking at this year are <a href="http://www.charitywater.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Charity Water</a> and a few on <a href="http://kiva.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kiva</a>
