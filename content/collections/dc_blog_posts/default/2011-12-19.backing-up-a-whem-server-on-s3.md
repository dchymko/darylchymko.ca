title: 'backing up a WHM server on s3'
---
I was looking for an off-site backup &nbsp;for my WHM VPS a while back and figured I'd use S3. &nbsp;A few minutes of research found that it wasn't all that hard to do. I essentially followed the link above but added a step to encrypt the backup files with AES256 before sending them to S3.<div><br></div><div>Don't forget to test you recovery plan on a regular basis as well :)</div>
