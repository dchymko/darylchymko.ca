title: 'Foursquare check-ins from Path'
---
I was really excied to see that Path includes the ability to push checkins to FourSquare. I don't know about you but I've been going through "Social Media burnout" so its nice when they become more integrated.

However, I found one small issue with the Path Foursquare checkins and that is they won't show up for anyone querying Foursquare via the API. This seems to be due to the fact that Path sends the check-ins without any geo-location data so FourSquare considers them a 'record keeping' check-ins rather than 'full' ones.

It's something to consider if you have any sort of app that consumes user checkins (like we have at the co+Lab).Â I've confirmed this behaviour on the Path app on both Android and iOS
