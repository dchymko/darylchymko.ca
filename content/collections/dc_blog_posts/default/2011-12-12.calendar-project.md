Once again, I'm printing up a calendar with my travel photos from 2011. But this year I've decided to change it up: I'm asking for a donation of $15 (or more if you want) for each calendar. The donations will go towards a Mayan Homestay project in the village of San Juan La Laguna on Lake Atitlan, Guatemala. I stayed in one of these homes while on my recent travels through Guatemala so I can tell you that this project is absolutely worthwhile of our support. Many of the photos in the Calendar are from San Juan with the rest taken across Guatemala and Belize.

The people of San Juan are incredible and have managed to embrace tourism while staying true to their Mayan roots. This project will help build a sustainable tourism infrastructure so that they are able to retain their culture and avoid the potential negatives that sometimes come with tourism. For more information on the project, see the <a title="Homestay project" href="http://www.planeterra.org/mayan-community-homestay-project-projects-55.php">Planeterra site</a>.

I am covering the printing costs so 100% of your donation will go to the project. Sample photos follow and the order form is at the bottom of the page.

Cheers and happy travels,
Daryl
