title: 'Remote backups are cheaper than you think'

This is the cost to backup all sites from my VPS to S3 (6.2GB).

Storage is cheap. Downtime &amp; lost data is expensive.

Setting it up is <a title="backing up a WHM server on s3" href="/images/dc_blog_posts/2011/12/backing-up-a-whem-server-on-s3/">easy</a>. There really is no excuse not to.
