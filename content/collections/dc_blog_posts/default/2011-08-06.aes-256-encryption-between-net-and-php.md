title: 'AES 256 encryption between .NET and PHP'
---
I finally got around to creating some sample code to demonstrate how to do Rijndael (AES-256) encryption between PHP and .NET servers.

They key probelm I found was that mcrypt pads the key with zeroes, where the default behaviour in .NET is PKCS7 padding. Use this line in your/net project to mimic the PHP behaviour.
<pre>symmetricKey.Padding = PaddingMode.Zeros;</pre>
<br />
You also have to remove the padded nulls from the end of string after you do the decryption:
<pre>result= result.TrimEnd('\0');</pre>
<br />
The complete working C# and PHP projects are here:
