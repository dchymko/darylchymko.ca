title: 'Travel checklists'

If you're like me, you like to be prepared when you head into the outdoors, be it a short day hike or week-long backpack. In the mad dash of packing, it's easy enough to forget one or two items that couple be crucial to your safety and or comfort.  I've used a set of my own checklists for years that I finally got around to throwing  into Google Docs. I figured sharing the link might helps others with their own preparations.  Feel free to custmize to your own tastes and if you have any modifications you think I should make, please let me know.
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AouvAXgnLnCbdHhCaXdDb2t2QWZ3S1dtMzRJcHZYUUE" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-421" title="checklist" src="/images/dc_blog_posts/2011/10/checklist1.png" alt="" width="425" height="142" /></a></p>
Don't forget, the two most important things:

-The right attitude
-Telling someone (trustworthy &amp; responsible) of your plans&amp; when you intend to return.
