title: 'Central America Calendar - Thank you!'
---
Hey everyone,

Thanks for supporting my Central America photo calendar project this year. A total of $315 was raised for Planeterra's Mayan Homestay project in Guatemala. The donations help the village of San Juan La Laguna develop sustainable, small-scale tourism to preserve the beauty, environment, and culture of the Lake Atitlan area. As you flip through the calendar over the upcoming year, take pride that your contribution helped the people and places in each of the 13 photos.

Happy 2012 and save travels,
Daryl
