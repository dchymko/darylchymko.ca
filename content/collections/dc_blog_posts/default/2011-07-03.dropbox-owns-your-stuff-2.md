Yikes.  Looks like Dropbox updated it's TOS to include an excusive copyright to all of your stuff.  The interwebs have been abuzz about this all day. Dropbox just issued an <a href="http://blog.dropbox.com/?p=846">update</a> claiming that the objectionable terms are only to be used in the context of operating the services.  Thoughts?
