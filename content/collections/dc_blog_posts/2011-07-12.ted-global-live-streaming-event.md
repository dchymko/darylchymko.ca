title: 'TED Global Live Streaming Event'
---
<p>This is kind of a last-minute initiative but I thought I'd send out a feeler anyway. TED Global 2011 started today and is being held all week in Scotland.  This is the "Main" TED conference where they have speakers at the top of their field presenting on various fascinating topics.  They've made the event available for live streaming for a fee of $500 for the entire session. This allows up to 10 viewers at any one time. While I can't sell tickets, I can ask for donations to recover the cost.
</p><p>
The event runs Monday to Thursday 8am-6pm GMT so I was envisioning streaming it in the Kickstart lounge at Accelerate Okanagan. Viewers could come in on a drop-in basis.  The only drawback is the time zone issue (GMT+1):
Wed: 12:30am-10:15am PDT
Thurs 3:15am-10:15am PDT
Fri: 12:30am-4:15am (Malcolm Gladwell is in the 1st half of this slot)
</p><p>
If anyone is interested please let me know ASAP so I can get this setup.
