title: 'Day 0 - Seattle'
---
<p>Made it to the Seattle airport. Winter is not all that far from hitting the Okanagan judging from the snow on the hills above the vallley. The landscape will probably look a whole lot more white when we get back!</p>
<p>I decided not to bring my DSLR with me due to weight and security issues so I was playing around with the Canon S90 that Clark lent me (Thanks Clark!). It's got a pretty fast lens for a point and shoot (F/2.0) and quite a bit of manual control so it should work out well. I took a couple of test shots on the flight down. Alaska Air also offered (free) Pyraamid IPA on the flight down which was pretty enjoyable as well. IfÂ  you can find some at your local store, I highly recommend it.</p>
<p>It's going to be a long night. Our flight from Houston leaves at 11pm (5hrs from now) and then we depart for Guatemala at 8am. I'm hoping to explore the city a bit on that first day but also have a 'siesta' in the plans.</p>
