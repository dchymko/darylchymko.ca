title: "Avoid the 'Walmarts' of tour companies"
---
I've travelled solo and I've travelled in a group.  My most recent trip to <a title="Panama and Costa Rica" href="http://www.gapadventures.com/trips/panama-experience/CRSP/2011/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Panama and Costa Rica</a> with Gap Adventures was awesome: Independent enough to let me do my own think while taking care of some of the 'mundane' planing details like finding quality (i.e. non-sketchy) accommodations. I highly recommend responsible &amp; sustainable travel companies such as GAP and Interepid  vs the 'discount shops'
