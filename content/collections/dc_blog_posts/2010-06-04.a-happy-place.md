title: 'The moment'
---
My definition of a happy freelancer is knowing that at any time you could get up and do something else but the work at that moment is so invigorating, so interesting that you can't help but be totally immersed and caught up in the task at hand. Â  I'm in that spot every day. ( Of course, 3pm beers on Thursday is an exception where I force myself to disengage for a brief escape! )
