title: 'Any.DO - Stunning UI'
---
On the weekend I came across the newly released Any.DO app. Now before you say "ANOTHER to-do app??", let me tell you this one is different. Any.DO sets a new UI bar way above anything else I've seen on Android. It looks beautiful and is amazingly intuitive. Drag and drop tasks, swipe to mark as complete, auto setting of call-backs everything is dead easy. Even if you don't use task-manage on your phone, check it out for the sheer beauty of the interface.
