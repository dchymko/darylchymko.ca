title: 'Giving Tuesday'
---
It's giving Tuesday and I'm going to sweeten up the deal. Make a donation to a registered charity and I'll randomly pick one and TRIPLE your donation. So you donate $100 and if yours gets picked, I'll donate an additional $300. If you've been on the fence about what to do with all that money you didn't spend on Black Friday, now is your chance.

Make your donation now and then post below (or message me)

Rules:
1) The donation must be made between now and 10am PST Wed Nov 30
2) It must be to a registered charity
3) I will contribute up to $500
4) The draw is at 12pm PST Wed Nov 3

Go!
