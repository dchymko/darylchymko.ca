            text: "I attended Startup Weekend Vancouver in 2010 and by the time the event was over, I had decided it was something I wanted to bring to the Okanagan. During the following summer, I formed an organizing\_committee\_and nine months later we held the very first\_Startup Weekend Okanagan. The event saw 65\_participants\_form into 10 teams that came out with a variety of amazing web apps and mobile solutions. The reaction from the community was extremely positive and we’re already organizing a follow-up event."

            text: " and myself have co-founded a shared work space for creative types in the technology and media fields. \_What started of as a small ambition to have 3 or 4 freelancers share an office quickly grew into a much larger ambition. The co+Lab officially opened it doors in September 2011 and is currently at 10 members with another 2 spaces to be added in January 2012. The benefits of being around other like-minded individuals have become apparent and several new ventures have already been formed between members."
