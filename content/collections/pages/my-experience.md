            text: 'Over the course of my career, I’ve built secure, scalable back-end systems for diverse applications, including my recent role at Automattic, where I contributed to projects like the privacy-focused journaling app Day One. I’ve developed high-performance platforms using tools like Java, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and AWS, from donation systems handling thousands of transactions to video streaming solutions optimized for low latency and high availability. Alongside technical work, I’ve mentored junior developers in agile practices, fostering best practices in code quality, testing, and deployment.'
