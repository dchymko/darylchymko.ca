            text: "After years of working in distributed companies like Automattic, I've noticed a clear pattern: the teams that thrive remotely are those with high trust and strong autonomy.

            text: "Here's the fascinating paradox of remote work: the less you try to control people, the more productive they become. It sounds counterintuitive, especially to traditional managers who worry that without direct oversight, work won't get done. Yet time and again, I've seen that the opposite is true."
